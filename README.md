# MultigradedImplicitization
This is a Macaulay2 package which leverages multigradings to solve difficult implicitization problems. This package and the other files in the repository are supplementary files for our recent preprint "Computing Implicitizations of Multi-Graded Polynomial Maps". 
For a detailed explanation of the files within we refer the user to our MathRepo page https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/MultigradedImplicitization/index.html or our paper.

The package comes with documentation which can be found by loading the package and then typing "viewHelp MultigradedImplicitization"
